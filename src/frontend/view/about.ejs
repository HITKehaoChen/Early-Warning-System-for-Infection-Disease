    With the continuous improvement of the economy and the medical technology, peopleâ€™s living conditions and sanitation
    facilities have been greatly improved. However, the human infectious disease with a higher prevalence can cause
    sudden
    public health incidents. They are more difficult to control and can easily cause public panic disorders. Early
    identification of infectious disease out breaks and takes prompt and effective measures in a timely, and can greatly
    reduce morbidity and mortality of infectious disease and loss of propert. Therefore, the monitoring of infectious
    disease, early detection of infectious disease outbreaks of dangerous diseases to make early alarming and prediction
    is the focus of attention and research. Motivated by this, we develop the alarming and prediction system for
    infection
    diseases. Such system integrates the data collected by hospital, pharmacies, and other infectious disease control
    monitoring system as well as Internet public opinion. And then through data processing, mining analysis, monitoring
    public opinion, as we as the integratio of BP artificial neural network modes, SIR model and the complex network
    model, the system provides early Alarming and Prediction and forecasting functions of infectious diseases.
    This system has the following characteristics:
    Accuracy: The system uses large amounts of data from public network, data mining in order to achieve accurate
    analysis
    and forecasting.
    Based on combined models:Our system involves a novel model as a combination of multiple models for accurate
    prediction. Such a model has a good portability, and can be applied in other areas, such as predicting advertising
    point and the trend of network public opinion.
    User-friendly: The system provides users with a simple interface, which is convenient and easy to understand.
